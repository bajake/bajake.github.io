<div class="entry-content"><p>At LinkedIn our CEO hosts a company-wide all hands meeting every two weeks. These events are live streamed to the dozens of offices around the world and gives employees the opportunity to understand what the company as a whole is working on.</p>

<p>Last week the theme of the meeting revolved around LinkedIn&rsquo;s goals and initiatives for 2014. Jeff (our CEO) gave an amazing presentation and while I&rsquo;m not going to go into specifics, I will let you know that one big focus is building out the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121210053039-22330283-the-future-of-linkedin-and-the-economic-graph" target="_blank">world&rsquo;s first economic graph</a>, something I am very excited about.</p>

<p>During the presentation, one other theme caught my attention. This was the idea of what LinkedIn is calling FoCuS, an acronym that has got me thinking a lot these days.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>FoCuS stands for</p>

<ul>
<li>Fewer things done better</li>
<li>Communicating the right information to the right people at the right time</li>
<li>Speed and quality of decisions</li>
</ul>


<p>While these three themes play off each other, the one I feel most attached to is the F. Fewer things done better.</p>

<p>Last week, one of my favorite companies, 37Signals, <a href="https://37signals.com/" target="_blank">made an announcement</a>. They declared that they will no longer be building new features into any of their existing products and instead focus on only one. For those who don&rsquo;t know, 37Signals is the creater of <a href="https://www.basecamp.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>, an incredibly popular project management tool used by millions of people around the world. They also make a small CRM tool called Highrise, a team chat tool called Campfire as well as a few other products to hep you do your job more efficiently. 37signals by design, is a fairly small company of about 43 employees and on February 5th, the 10th anniversary of the company, they announced that they would be embracing the F and only focus on one product, Basecamp. They even changed their name from 37signals to Basecamp to let everyone know that they are completely set on doing fewer things, and in this case one thing, better.</p>

<p>As others have said, no one can do their best work when they are spread too thin. Whether it be your projects, your team or your company, not being able to focus can only lead to incomplete thoughts and work. I personally struggle with this concept day in and day out as there are many things that I would like to learn, do and experience, yet I know deep down that embracing the F will make me stronger and more valuable in the long run. &ldquo;Jack of all trades, master of none&rdquo; is a quote that scares me a bit as I know that I try to soak up knowledge yet often don&rsquo;t end up mastering what I have learned.</p>

<p>The best definition of minimalism I have found goes something like this</p>

<blockquote><p>Minimalism is a lifestyle that helps people question what things add value to their lives. By clearing the clutter from life&rsquo;s path, we can all make room for the most important aspects of our lives.</p></blockquote>

<p>This succinct statement can mean different things to different people but for me, the idea of fewer things done better falls right in line with this concept. Having too many projects, ideas or things adds clutter to the mind and holds one back from the true passions of life.</p>

<p>So starting today, like LinkedIn and 37Signals, I am going to take an inventory of everything I am working on, decide what is most important, then figure out how pass off the projects that are not. I&rsquo;m finally starting to embrace the F and maybe you can too.</p>
