<div class="entry-content"><p>It has been almost a year since I published anything on this blog and feel it is time to again make this a regular space to put down my thoughts.</p>

<p>Many things have changed since March of last year, most notably moving from the sun drenched state of Colorado, of which I have called home for the last 26 years, to the optimistic and beautiful city by the bay, San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>A handful of reasons led to this life altering event but now that I have been here for almost nine months, the risk has already paid off ten fold. The people, the ideas, the entrepreneurship, the food, the scenery have all led me to believe this is hands down the most perfect place for me to be at this point in my life.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Being an idealist in which I believe technology can make the world a better place, I felt it quite imperative to find a job in the heart of what some are calling the <a href="http://www.kqed.org/a/forum/R201401271000" target="_blank">second machine age</a>. Silicon Valley is like no other place on earth and for years I was watching as <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460" target="_blank">software was eating the world</a> from the <a href="/blog/2013/02/19/how-tesla-netflix-and-nest-are-using-smart-data-to-completely-redefine-the-game/">sidelines</a>. If I were to help contribute to the bettering of society through technology and innovative thinking, it was time to become a little over my head and surround myself with the <a href="/blog/2013/03/12/the-smartest-people-in-the-internet-chat-room/">smartest people I could find</a>.</p>

<p>Once the decision to move to the bay area was complete, the next steps were finding a company that shared the same values that I did. Drive, Integrity, Compassion. After lack of openings at the various companies I already admired in the area, I ran across this amazingly refreshing video from LinkedIn&rsquo;s CEO Jeff Wiener. (It is bit long at 40 minutes but well worth your time investment.)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2x0fOLqj2Zw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>I was blown away! If this was the thought process of the leader of the company, I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine what it was like to work there. I immediately logged on to LinkedIn, a place where I was spending more and more time throughout my job search, and began looking at openings at LinkedIn itself. How meta. I immediately found a job perfectly suited for my skills and background and saved it for later. I knew I would have to write a kick ass cover letter to get my foot in the door at such an influential company.</p>

<p>A few days later, I was visiting some friends in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and penned this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bldtl3i14qzopcr/xgAVcBlKCm" target="_blank"> cover  letter</a> while sitting in the UNC library. I had no idea if it would even be read. Yet to my surprise, a couple days later I received a call from one of LinkedIn&rsquo;s recruiters.</p>

<p>After a second phone interview and a visit to the campus, I received a job offer. The dream had become a reality. I packed up my car, headed west and the rest they say is history.</p>

<p>Now that I have finally settled in, I plan to share more thoughts on LinkedIn&rsquo;s incredible management style, the local tech industry as well as how my interest in minimalism permeates through all of the above.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
