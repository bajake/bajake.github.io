<div class="entry-content"><p>For years, I have been a fan and follower of <a href="http://www.usethis.com" target="_blank"> The Setup</a>, a blog dedicated to interviewing various people on their computer hardware and software setups. Everyone from chefs to programmers to cosplayers (something I didn’t even know existed) have been featured. Being someone who is fascinated by how technology interacts with everyday life, The Setup does a great job of asking simple questions to get to the core of what people think about the technology/tools they use everyday and where they could be taken in the future.</p>

<p>Since I am definitely not important enough to end up on the site, I thought I would share what I use to get stuff done.</p>

<h3>Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>

<p>Hi, I’m Jake Bailey and I am the Technology and Operations manager for SlimGenics, a health and wellness company headquartered in Denver, CO. Being a native, I do everything I can to take advantage of the 300+ days of sunshine a year. Activities include but are not limited to hiking, camping, skiing and biking (mountain and road). I am also a connoisseur of sandwiches and a minimalist in training.</p>

<h3>What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p>Currently I enjoy a 2011 Core i7 Macbook Air that my current company provided me. It has a 250GB SSD drive and 4 GB of memory and runs Mountain Lion, all which offer plenty of power, storage and flexibility for the limited amount of strain I put on the system. At the office I connect this to a 27-inch Thunderbolt Display, a Magic Mouse and a full size Apple wired keyboard. I have found the wireless keyboards eat batteries for breakfast.</p>

<p>I am addicted to my iPhone 5. This is one of my favorite possessions because it is my portable window into the entire world.</p>

<p>I recently received an iPad as a gift and to tell you the truth, I only use it to surf the web on the couch or read an article or two at breakfast. I tend to find myself reaching for my Kindle more and more these days due to the fact that I can disconnect and focus on reading.</p>

<p>I write notes and ideas in a graphed hardcover Moleskin notebook and watch Netflix and stream music on my AppleTV.</p>

<p>Finally, all portables get put into a Chrome Citizen Bag while I ride around town on an 80’s Centurion Sport DLX bicycle.</p>

<h3>What software do you use?</h3>

<h4>Work</h4>

<p>On the job I live in Salesforce.com for company analytics and marketing automation, ExactTarget for sending and tracking emails, Magento to access and manage the company website, Basecamp for project management, Evernote for taking notes, and Gchat for interacting with my team of developers that work remotely.</p>

<h4>Personal</h4>

<p>At home, Twitter is my news source, Simple is my new bank and finance app, Spotify has completely replaced iTunes for music, Adobe Creative Suite powers through design projects and Sublime 2 and the very simple Terminal.app are used for my increasing interest in development.</p>

<p>Finally, everything is backed up to either Dropbox or Amazon’s S3 using Arq.</p>

<h4>What is your dream set-up?</h4>

<p>I am actually pretty satisfied with my current set-up for the time being. However, since this is a dream, here is what it would look like.</p>

<p>On the hardware side, I would really like a Macbook Air with a higher resolution display and LTE built in so I could use it anywhere. Having it tether to my iPhone would be nice too, that way I’m not paying ATT more then necessary. Actually free, citywide WiFi would be better…</p>

<p>On the software front, I think it would be great if I could store my entire computer (apps, settings, files, software, etc) all in the cloud where it could be accessed from any device. A virtual server of sorts except for your personal computer. I want to be able to work anywhere, with any machine at any time without having to worry about what software is where.</p>

<p>Also, no wires for anything, including charging. I despise having to remember to bring various chargers with me everywhere I go. Free, citywide WiFi charging perhaps?</p>
