<div class="entry-content"><p>The last few weeks have provided a unique look behind the curtain of how a few companies are using connected networks and devices to completely redefine the markets they compete in. No longer are we just talking about how cheap storage or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank">Big Data</a> will change the business landscape, we are actually living it. New companies, run by connected, technologically savvy leaders are putting data first and reaping the rewards in surprisingly unique ways.</p>

<h3>The Internet of Things has Officially Arrived!</h3>

<p>Before we look at what these companies are doing, I think a little history lesson is in order.</p>

<p>The concept of the “Internet of Things” (IoT) was <a href="http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986" target="_blank">first introduced</a> over a decade ago, when in 1999, Kevin Ashton gave a presentation to Proctor &amp; Gamble in which he linked the new idea of RFID tags with the still then emerging Internet. Needless to say, his presentation succeeded in getting executive attention focused on their supply chain. Now, 14 years later, Kevin’s overarching concept is finally starting to take shape,</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The general idea was that if we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things—using data they gathered without any help from us—we would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best. The Internet of Things has the potential to change the world, just as the Internet did. Maybe even more so.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Data capture and storage has vastly improved since 1999 and what recent news is proving is that we are hitting a tipping point for how data is being used to not only differentiate companies from the competition but how it is vastly improving the world around us.</p>

<h3>He Who Owns the Data, Owns the Future</h3>

<h4>Tesla</h4>

<p>One of the bigger stories to come out this last week was the back and forth between New York Times columnist John Broder and Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Motors. The disagreement came about when John Broder wrote a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/automobiles/stalled-on-the-ev-highway.html?ref=automobiles&_r=1&" target="_blank">scathing review</a> of the poor battery life in the new Model S electric sedan. Musk <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/most-peculiar-test-drive" target="_blank">refuted the claims</a> by provided detailed driving records of John Broder’s entire trip. There is a <a href="http://www.thewire.com/technology/2013/02/elon-musks-data-doesnt-back-his-claims-new-york-times-fakery/62149/" target="_blank">whole discussion</a> on who was actually right in this argument, but what interests me most is that this type of discussion is actually happening.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jason">@Jason</a> Actually, I&#39;m not questioning anyone&#39;s data. I am just observing that it is fascinating that data is now fact.</p>&mdash; Nick Bilton (@nickbilton) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbilton/statuses/302134592389922817">February 14, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Nick Bilton, a tech writer at the New York Times tried to defend his colleagues story by asking how the data was collected in the first place. While a valid point, Musk’s charts definitely seem to have more authority then Broder’s words.</p>

<p>When I get into my trusty 2003 Honda Civic, you know what I can track? My speed, how much gas I have left and the distance I have traveled. That’s it, and that is if I look at the dashboard. Less then 10 years later, Tesla owners can now track and interact with almost every aspect of their car from an app on their phone. Telsa even issued their first <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/09/tesla-over-the-air/" target="_blank">over the air</a> update to the Model S’s software last fall. This is the future of the automotive market. GM, Ford, Toyota and the other car companies now just get to play catch-up to an electric car company.</p>

<h4>Netflix</h4>

<p>The movie by mail/movie by internet company has also been getting a lot of press recently, mostly for their bold move to release their new show, “House of Cards” all at once. Why did they do this? What makes them so certain that this new way of distributing television will catch on? Well, as you can guess, they have data to back up their decision.</p>

<p>Slate’s Andrew Leonard addresses these ideas in the Big Brother sounding <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/01/how_netflix_is_turning_viewers_into_puppets/" target="_blank">“How Netflix is turning viewers into puppets”</a>. It is no secret that Netflix is a <a href="http://readwrite.com/2011/07/26/netflixs_big_data_plans_to_take_over_the_world#awesm=~ou1Gjco76AmBjX" target="_blank">data behemoth</a>. Now it is finally using what it has learned to compete with the likes of traditional TV and HBO, the reigning go to source for high quality small screen entertainment. With the ability to monitor when we rate, watch or even pause a show, Netflix is learning what we like.</p>

<p>Of course, this is what TV has been doing for decade, putting a new show out, monitoring Nielson data, then alter the offering. Wash, rinse, repeat. Like Mr. Leonard states, why else is there a hundred different vampire or zombie shows on right now? Because it sells. What makes Netflix different is how deep it can actually go with the data. Before it was just themes, now it comes down to if we like to “mainline” our TV shows as opposed to spreading them out over weeks. This type of analysis is the birthplace for new ideas and innovation. Offering a show all at once in my mind is an entirely new type of entertainment. Sure I can watch a 2 hour movie or a 30 minute sitcom but what about a 10 hour drama with true character development and a plot line that can twist and turn for seasons on end. That is something that excites me.</p>

<p>With all this data though, will new programming be decided by algorithms instead of the artistic vision of a director? Will we be getting robot produced TV? Mr. Leonard thinks that may be the case. As Steve Jobs said,</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>And to this I say behavior is much more valuable then asking someone what they like. Data is just going to be another tool in a director’s toolbox and hopefully content will become better and more targeted because of it.</p>

<p>While we won’t know if this strategy will help Netflix’s bottom line until the financials come out next quarter, I am looking forward to where this space is going and I applaud them for taking the risk to enter the ring first.</p>

<h4>Nest</h4>

<p>Sexy thermostats. Two words that were never even put together in a sentence before Tony Fadell and Matt Rodgers redefined the genre in 2010. In a <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/511086/how-nests-control-freaks-reinvented-the-thermostat/" target="_blank">new article</a> released by MIT’s Technology Review, we learn that Nest was founded after Tony, a former Apple executive, decided to build a fully connected and future proof home. When it came to purchase a high end thermostat to control the systems in the house, he was baffled that they cost upwards of $500 a piece and were essentially brain-dead. He thought he could build a better one himself, and so he did.</p>

<p>Now, almost three years later, Nest has sold hundreds of thousands of their new thermostats and saved users $29 million in energy bills. Quite an achievement for something that just sits on the wall. By providing an easy interface and a simple concept, turning the temperature up or down, Nest has taken what is essentially an on/off switch and made it smart. Also by selling the device directly to consumers, which is a different approach then leading HVAC companies like Honeywell or Venstar who sell through distributors, Nest can use data to watch how the device is used and adapt.</p>

<blockquote><p>For example, Nest thermostats originally adjusted themselves to an energy-conserving setting in the morning two hours after detecting that human activity in a home had stopped. They waited that long in case the owner soon returned home. But anonymous data from Nest thermostats revealed that people reliably stayed out for quite a while when they left in the morning. So the company sent a software update to all the thermostats to take that into account. Now the devices turn themselves down after just 30 minutes.</p></blockquote>

<p>This new way of heating and cooling in the home has made the data lacking incumbents very scared as well. Honeywell, which <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dividendchannel/2013/02/19/honeywell-international-takes-over-58-spot-from-monsanto/" target="_blank">just recently</a> became the 58th largest company on the S&amp;P 500, has recently sued 150 person Nest for patent infringement. The case is still being worked out in the courts, but whatever the outcome, Nest’s data set has a huge head start on the competition.</p>

<p>Lastly, Nest, even more so then Tesla or Netflix, is the perfect example of Kevin Ashton’s Internet of Things. A simple disc on the wall is teaching people how to save energy, save money and could eventually help power a more responsive smart grid in the United States. If that isn’t the definition of changing the world, then I don’t know what is.</p>

<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>All this use of smart data and innovation is only valuable if it can be sustained long term. So while stock price is only one way to look at company success, I think it does a decent job of outlining market share, stockholder value and if the company has a future.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tesla’s stock price, since going public in June 2010, is up 105%. (Full disclosure &ndash; I am an extremely small investor.)</li>
<li>Netflix’s stock, while still recovering from the Qwikster incident in 2011, is up 112% year to date.</li>
<li>Nest, a private company who doesn’t release financial figures has released sales figures “in the mid-hundreds of thousands” as of September 2012.</li>
</ul>


<p>Exciting times!</p>
