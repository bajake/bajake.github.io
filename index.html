  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been almost a year since I published anything on this blog and feel it is time to again make this a regular space to put down my thoughts.</p>

<p>Many things have changed since March of last year, most notably moving from the sun drenched state of Colorado, of which I have called home for the last 26 years, to the optimistic and beautiful city by the bay, San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>A handful of reasons led to this life altering event but now that I have been here for almost nine months, the risk has already paid off ten fold. The people, the ideas, the entrepreneurship, the food, the scenery have all led me to believe this is hands down the most perfect place for me to be at this point in my life.</p>

<p>This list would not be complete without Steve Jobs so I will end with one of my favorite quotes. This is from his father and influenced him the rest of his life.</p>

<blockquote><p>When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood in the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.</p></blockquote>

<p>Who inspires you on a daily basis?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For years, I have been a fan and follower of <a href="http://www.usethis.com" target="_blank"> The Setup</a>, a blog dedicated to interviewing various people on their computer hardware and software setups. Everyone from chefs to programmers to cosplayers (something I didn’t even know existed) have been featured. Being someone who is fascinated by how technology interacts with everyday life, The Setup does a great job of asking simple questions to get to the core of what people think about the technology/tools they use everyday and where they could be taken in the future.</p>

<p>Since I am definitely not important enough to end up on the site, I thought I would share what I use to get stuff done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last few weeks have provided a unique look behind the curtain of how a few companies are using connected networks and devices to completely redefine the markets they compete in. No longer are we just talking about how cheap storage or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank">Big Data</a> will change the business landscape, we are actually living it. New companies, run by connected, technologically savvy leaders are putting data first and reaping the rewards in surprisingly unique ways.</p>

<h3>The Internet of Things has Officially Arrived!</h3>

<p>Before we look at what these companies are doing, I think a little history lesson is in order.</p>

<p>The concept of the “Internet of Things” (IoT) was <a href="http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986" target="_blank">first introduced</a> over a decade ago, when in 1999, Kevin Ashton gave a presentation to Proctor &amp; Gamble in which he linked the new idea of RFID tags with the still then emerging Internet. Needless to say, his presentation succeeded in getting executive attention focused on their supply chain. Now, 14 years later, Kevin’s overarching concept is finally starting to take shape,</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The general idea was that if we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things—using data they gathered without any help from us—we would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best. The Internet of Things has the potential to change the world, just as the Internet did. Maybe even more so.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Data capture and storage has vastly improved since 1999 and what recent news is proving is that we are hitting a tipping point for how data is being used to not only differentiate companies from the competition but how it is vastly improving the world around us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A solid recipe for success.</p>

<blockquote><p>Wake up early. Show up. Learn how to think. Be genuine, but appear nice. Use envy for motivation instead of destruction. Do what you say you’re going to do. Ensure balance in every area of your life. Confront repressed thoughts immediately. Surround yourself with people who are better than you (but remember the thing about envy). Work out every day. Be good at what you do. Make money doing what you love. Have good friends. Never settle.</p><footer><strong>Dustin Curtis</strong> <cite><a href='http://dcurt.is/do'>Do</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Some additions I would like to add:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Travel and experience points of view different from your own</em></li>
<li><em>Sit back and enjoy the moment as often as possible</em></li>
<li><em>Read</em></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to coding, I am what the interwebs refer to as a newbie, a newcomer, a novice. Sure, I took an HTML class in college and made a few crappy websites but since then, all I have been able to do is go into some content management system (CMS) and change a few lines of HTML or CSS. I have never really understood how it all works. A few months ago, I decided to attempt a change in my ignorance.</p>

<p>Since I use applications, websites, and databases everyday in my job, I know good technology when I see it. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/26/jack-dorsey-talks-square-twitter-and-instagram-facebook-with-charlie-rose/">Jack Dorsey</a>, the founder of Twitter and Square, says it best,</p>

<blockquote><p>The best technologies disappear, they fade into the background and are relevant when you use them and get out of the way when you don’t.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is a great saying but how do you create the application in the first place? I needed somewhere to start.</p>
